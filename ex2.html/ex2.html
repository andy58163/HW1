   I bet you feel it now, baby
  Especially since we&#39;ve only known each other one day
  But, I&#39;ve got to work shit out, baby
  I&#39;m exercising demons, got &#39;em running &#39;round the block now
   
  Location drop, now
  Pedal to the floor like you&#39;re running from the cops now
  Oh, what a cop out
  You picked a dance with the devil and you lucked out
   
  The water&#39;s getting colder
  Let me in your ocean, swim
  Out in California, I&#39;ve been forward stroking, swim
  So hard to ignore ya&#39;, &#39;specially when I&#39;m smoking, swim
  World is on my shoulders
  Keep your body open, swim
  I&#39;m swimming, I&#39;m swimming, I&#39;m swimming, yeah
  I&#39;m swimming, I&#39;m swimming, I&#39;m swimming, yeah
  Out in California, I&#39;ve been forward stroking, swim
  So hard to ignore ya&#39;, keep your body open, swim
   
  Pop a couple pills in the daytime
  Heard you got a friend, what’s her head like?
  Probably should&#39;ve fucked on the first night
  Now I gotta wait for the green light
  I don&#39;t wanna wait for no green light
  Narcolepsy got me feeling stage fright
  Luckily I&#39;ve flown at insane heights
  Luckily, luckily, luckily, ya
   
  Location drop, now
  Pedal to the floor like you&#39;re running from the cops now
  Oh, what a cop out
  You picked a dance with the devil and you lucked out
   
  The water&#39;s getting colder
  Let me in your ocean, swim
  Out in California, I&#39;ve been forward stroking, swim
  So hard to ignore ya&#39;, &#39;specially when I&#39;m smoking, swim
  World is on my shoulders
  Keep your body open, swim
  I&#39;m swimming, I&#39;m swimming, I&#39;m swimming, yeah
  I&#39;m swimming, I&#39;m swimming, I&#39;m swimming, yeah
  Out in California, I&#39;ve been forward stroking, swim
  So hard to ignore ya&#39;, keep your body open, swim
   
  Swim, push the water to the edge and watch it drip
  Check your footing, don&#39;t get caught up in the rip
  I know I said I&#39;d call, I never did, no
  Swim, swim now
  I can take you even though I&#39;ve never been there
  The tide has currently been thrashing around me again and again
  I&#39;ve been drowning for a minute, your body keeps pulling me in
   
  The water&#39;s getting colder
